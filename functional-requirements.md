## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the functional requirements for "The Ephemera Codex" website. It describes the features, functionalities, and technical specifications necessary to create an immersive and interactive experience that reflects the themes and content of the project. This document serves as a guide for development using Bolt, Google Gemini, and GitHub Copilot, ensuring a shared understanding among stakeholders and the AI assistants.

### 1.2 Scope

This document covers the core functionalities of "The Ephemera Codex" website, including:

*   User interface and navigation
*   Narrative presentation (INT3RN4L_3RR0R_ST0RY)
*   Technical components (GregOS, Project Amoratus)
*   Ethical and philosophical considerations
*   Interactive elements and personalization features

It does not cover backend infrastructure (beyond what Bolt provides), detailed server-side logic (unless essential for core functionality), or external integrations not explicitly mentioned in the project plan.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is intended for:

*   **The Developer** (you, working with Bolt, Gemini, and Copilot)
*   **Google Gemini** (as a "Software Architect" to understand the project)
*   **GitHub Copilot** (as a coding assistant)
*   **Potential Stakeholders** (anyone interested in the project's development)

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

"The Ephemera Codex" website is a standalone, interactive digital experience that extends the narrative and technical concepts of the eponymous project. It's designed to be a self-contained artifact, immersing users in the world of Greg Reeves, GregOS, and Project Amoratus. The website will be accessible through modern web browsers and built using Bolt's in-browser development environment.

### 2.2 User Classes and Characteristics

*   **Explorers:** Users interested in interactive fiction, narrative experiences, and unique presentations of digital content. They are expected to be comfortable with non-linear navigation and exploring a complex information space.
*   **Tech Enthusiasts:** Individuals fascinated by the technical aspects of GregOS and Project Amoratus. They are likely to have some programming knowledge and an interest in speculative technology.
*   **Emotional Explorers:** Users drawn to the emotional core of Greg's story, themes of grief, memory, and human connection. They appreciate introspection and psychological depth.
*   **Academics/Researchers:** Individuals interested in the project's philosophical and ethical implications, particularly regarding consciousness, memory manipulation, and the intersection of technology and human experience.

### 2.3 Operating Environment

*   **Platform:** Web-based application, built and hosted within the Bolt environment.
*   **Accessibility:** The website should strive to meet basic accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to be usable by a wider audience, including providing options for adjusting text size, contrast, and animation speed where applicable.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** The website should function correctly on modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **Responsiveness:** The website should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices).

### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints

*   **Development Environment:** Bolt's WebContainer-based environment, which has limitations regarding native binaries, certain shell commands, and package management (no `pip`, limited `python` and `python3` to standard libraries, no C/C++ compiler).
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Frontend:** React with JavaScript/TypeScript.
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
    *   **State Management:** Context API with useReducer.
*   **AI Assistants:** Development will heavily rely on Google Gemini (for architectural guidance and problem-solving) and GitHub Copilot (for code completion and implementation).
*   **Performance:** The website should load quickly and respond smoothly to user interactions, considering the limitations of the Bolt environment.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

*   The developer has a basic understanding of web development and the chosen technology stack.
*   The developer is familiar with using Google Gemini and GitHub Copilot.
*   Bolt's infrastructure will remain stable and accessible throughout development.
