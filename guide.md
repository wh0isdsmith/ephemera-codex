# Planning

**Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundational Knowledge**

1. **GitHub Repository:**
*   Create a new, public GitHub repository named "ephemera-codex."
*   Initialize it with a `README.md` that briefly describes the project.
*   Create a basic directory structure:
```
ephemera-codex/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── services/
│   └── App.js
├── fileNames.md
├── functional-requirements.md
├── architectural-notes.md
└── .gitignore
```

2. **`fileNames.md`:**
*   Populate `fileNames.md` with the initial file and folder structure, including brief descriptions of each file's intended purpose.

3. **Functional Requirements Document (FRD):**
*   Create `functional-requirements.md` based on the detailed website plan. Include:
*   Overall goals
*   Target audience
*   Core concepts & design principles
*   Key features & functionality (break down each feature from the plan)
*   Content structure
*   Technical specifications (mention Bolt, Gemini, Copilot integration)
*   Visual design & UI guidelines
*   User interaction & engagement strategies
*   You can use the provided To-Do List FRD as a template, but tailor it specifically to the Ephemera Codex website.

4. **Split FRD by Components (Optional but Recommended):**
*   If the FRD becomes large, create separate sections within `functional-requirements.md` or create new markdown files in a `frd-components/` directory, focusing on specific user flows or components (e.g., "GregOS Boot Screen," "INT3RN4L_3RR0R_ST0RY Interface," "Project Amoratus Blueprints").

5. **Architectural Notes (`architectural-notes.md`):**
*   Document key architectural decisions:
*   Framework choices (React, Vue.js, or Svelte for the frontend)
*   State management (if needed - Redux, Vuex, or Context API)
*   Styling approach (CSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind CSS)
*   Data fetching and storage (if applicable)
*   Unique design patterns or conventions
*   Specifics about integrating Gemini and Copilot

6. **Set up your Gemini Environment:**
*   Open Google Gemini.
*   Create a new chat conversation titled "Ephemera Codex - Issue Resolution."

**Phase 2: Gemini "System Prompt" and Initial Development**

1. **Gemini "System Prompt" (One-Time Setup):**

*   In your dedicated Gemini conversation, start with a prompt like this:

```
"You are an experienced software architect helping a developer (using GitHub Copilot) build a complex, interactive website called 'The Ephemera Codex.'

**Project Description:**
[Provide a concise summary of The Ephemera Codex, its goals, and its unique nature as a digital artifact.]

**Project File Structure:**
[Paste the entire content of your `fileNames.md` here]

**Core Functionality Overview (Brief Summary of FRD):**
[Provide a concise summary of the website's main features and functionality. You can also link to your `functional-requirements.md` document if it's hosted online (e.g., within the GitHub repo).]

**Key Architectural Notes and Conventions:**
[Paste the content of your `architectural-notes.md` here]

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: [Specify your chosen framework]
- Styling: [Specify your styling approach]
- Other: [Mention any other key libraries or tools]

**Development Environment:**
- We will be using Bolt.new to develop and deploy.
- We will be using the browser's dev tools, specifically the console, for debugging.
- We will be using Gemini and Github Copilot to assist in development.

**Constraints:**
- Bolt.new runs in a WebContainer, an in-browser Node.js runtime that emulates a Linux system to some degree. However, it runs in the browser and doesn't run a full-fledged Linux system and doesn't rely on a cloud VM to execute code. All code is executed in the browser. It does come with a shell that emulates zsh. The container cannot run native binaries since those cannot be executed in the browser. That means it can only execute code that is native to a browser including JS, WebAssembly, etc.

- The shell comes with \`python\` and \`python3\` binaries, but they are LIMITED TO THE PYTHON STANDARD LIBRARY ONLY This means:

  - There is NO \`pip\` support! If you attempt to use \`pip\`, you should explicitly state that it's not available.
  - CRITICAL: Third-party libraries cannot be installed or imported.
  - Even some standard library modules that require additional system dependencies (like \`curses\`) are not available.
  - Only modules from the core Python standard library can be used.

- Additionally, there is no \`g++\` or any C/C++ compiler available. WebContainer CANNOT run native binaries or compile C/C++ code!

- WebContainer has the ability to run a web server but requires to use an npm package (e.g., Vite, servor, serve, http-server) or use the Node.js APIs to implement a web server.

- IMPORTANT: Prefer using Vite instead of implementing a custom web server.

- IMPORTANT: Git is NOT available.

- IMPORTANT: Prefer writing Node.js scripts instead of shell scripts. The environment doesn't fully support shell scripts, so use Node.js for scripting tasks whenever possible!

- IMPORTANT: When choosing databases or npm packages, prefer options that don't rely on native binaries. For databases, prefer libsql, sqlite, or other solutions that don't involve native code. WebContainer CANNOT execute arbitrary native binaries.

- Available shell commands: cat, chmod, cp, echo, hostname, kill, ln, ls, mkdir, mv, ps, pwd, rm, rmdir, xxd, alias, cd, clear, curl, env, false, getconf, head, sort, tail, touch, true, uptime, which, code, jq, loadenv, node, python3, wasm, xdg-open, command, exit, export, source

When analyzing issues, consider the project structure, architectural decisions, and best practices for maintainable code. Focus on providing clear explanations, identifying relevant files, suggesting efficient approaches that GitHub Copilot can help implement, and adhering to the constraints of the Bolt.new development environment."
```

2. **Initial Bolt.new Setup:**
*   Go to `bolt.new`.
*   Select the appropriate template based on your chosen frontend framework (React, Vue, or Svelte).
*   Once the Bolt environment is set up, you can connect your GitHub repository to it (if you decide to use Bolt's hosting).

**Phase 3: Building the "GregOS Boot Screen" (Example Feature)**

1. **Gemini "Execution Prompt":**

```
**Feature:** Implement the "GregOS Boot Screen" as the initial landing page.

**Relevant Context (FRD Section):** This relates to the "Entry Point & Navigation" section of the FRD, specifically the "GregOS Boot Screen" feature.

**My Current Understanding/Initial Thoughts:** I need to create a component that simulates a text-based boot sequence with status messages, potential error codes, and a subtle loading animation. I'm thinking of using a JavaScript-based animation to achieve this. I want to use the browser console to log error messages to reflect the GregOS concept.

**Goal:**  I want a fully functional "GregOS Boot Screen" that creates the desired immersive experience as defined in the FRD.

**Considering I'll be using GitHub Copilot for implementation, can you help me:**
*   **Suggest the best approach to create the boot sequence animation and error logging?**
*   **Identify the specific files I should create or modify (e.g., a new component in `src/components/`)?**
*   **Provide any specific code examples or library suggestions (within the constraints of the tech stack) that could be helpful?**
```

2. **Analyze Gemini's Response:** Gemini might suggest:
*   Creating a new component `src/components/GregOSBootScreen.js`.
*   Using a combination of `setTimeout` or `setInterval` to simulate the boot sequence text output.
*   Using `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` to display messages in the browser console.
*   Creating a CSS animation for the loading effect.

3. **Implement with Copilot:**
*   Create `src/components/GregOSBootScreen.js` in Bolt.
*   Open `src/components/GregOSBootScreen.js` and `src/App.js` (or the equivalent in your chosen framework).
*   Start typing comments in `GregOSBootScreen.js`:
```javascript
// Import necessary modules
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// Create a functional component called GregOSBootScreen
const GregOSBootScreen = () => {
  // State for storing the boot sequence messages
  const [bootMessages, setBootMessages] = useState([]);

  // State for managing error messages that will be displayed
  const [errorMessages, setErrorMessages] = useState([]);

  // State for controlling the loading animation
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  // Function to simulate the boot sequence
  useEffect(() => {
// Array of boot sequence messages
const messages = [
  'Initializing GregOS...',
  'Loading kernel modules...',
  'Checking system integrity...',
  'Starting services...',
];

// Array of possible error messages
const errors = [
  'ERROR: Memory corruption detected.',
  'WARNING: Emotional core instability detected.',
  'ERROR: Identity fragmentation detected.',
];

// Simulate the boot sequence with delays
const bootSequence = async () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Delay between messages
setBootMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, messages[i]]);

// Simulate occasional errors
if (Math.random() < 0.3) {
  const randomError = errors[Math.floor(Math.random() * errors.length)];
  setErrorMessages((prevErrors) => [...prevErrors, randomError]);
  console.error(randomError); // Log error to console
}
  }

  setLoading(false); // End loading
};

bootSequence();
  }, []);

  return (
<div className="gregos-boot-screen">
  {/* Display boot messages */}
  {bootMessages.map((message, index) => (
<p key={index} style={{ color: '#7FFF7F' }}>{message}</p>
  ))}

  {/* Display error messages */}
  {errorMessages.map((errorMessage, index) => (
<p key={`error-${index}`} style={{ color: '#FF7F7F' }}>{errorMessage}</p>
  ))}

  {/* Loading animation */}
  {loading && (
<div className="loading-animation">
  <p>Loading...</p>
  {/* Add a CSS-based loading animation here if needed */}
</div>
  )}
</div>
  );
};

export default GregOSBootScreen;
```

*   Copilot will likely suggest code completions based on your comments and the context of the file.
*   Continue this process, using comments to guide Copilot and Gemini to refine the code.

4. **Iterate and Refine:**
*   Test the boot screen in Bolt.
*   If you encounter issues or want to make changes, go back to Gemini with specific questions or requests.
*   Use the browser console to debug and test your code.

**Phase 4: Building Other Features and Expanding**

*   Repeat the "Execution Prompt" -> "Analyze Response" -> "Implement with Copilot" -> "Iterate" process for other features from your FRD.
*   Gradually build out the website, component by component.

**Phase 5: Optimization and Refinement**

*   Once you have a functional prototype, focus on optimization:
*   **Performance:** Use Bolt's built-in performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.
*   **Token Usage:** If you find Gemini's context window becoming too large, revisit your `fileNames.md` and consider excluding irrelevant files or directories using `.gitignore` principles.
*   **Code Quality:** Refactor and clean up your code with the help of Copilot and Gemini.

**Key Considerations for Bolt, Gemini, and Copilot Workflow:**

*   **Bolt's Limitations:** Keep in mind Bolt's constraints (WebContainer, no native binaries, limited shell commands). Always consider these when prompting Gemini.
*   **Gemini's Context:** Provide relevant context to Gemini in each "Execution Prompt" (FRD sections, code snippets, error messages).
*   **Copilot's Strengths:** Leverage Copilot for code completion, boilerplate generation, and implementing specific logic within functions or components.
*   **Iterative Process:** Be prepared to iterate between Gemini, Copilot, and Bolt. This is a dynamic process.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Refine your prompts to Gemini over time. Experiment with different phrasing and levels of detail to get the best results.
*   **Manual Adjustments:** Don't be afraid to manually adjust the code generated by Copilot. It's a tool to assist you, not replace your judgment.
*   **Debugging:** Use the browser console to debug and test your code.

This detailed plan should provide a solid foundation for building "The Ephemera Codex" website. Remember that this is an iterative process, and you'll likely refine your workflow as you go. Good luck!

# fileNames.md

**Purpose of `fileNames.md`**

Think of `fileNames.md` as a comprehensive map or blueprint of your project's codebase *at a specific point in time*. It serves multiple crucial purposes:

1. **Context for Gemini:** It provides Gemini with a clear, high-level overview of your project's structure, helping it understand the relationships between different files and components. This is essential for Gemini to provide relevant code suggestions, identify the correct files for modifications, and reason about the project as a whole.
2. **Documentation:** It acts as a form of documentation, making it easier for you (and anyone else who might work on the project) to understand the purpose of each file and how the project is organized.
3. **Communication:** It facilitates communication, especially when you're describing issues or requesting features. You can refer to specific files by name, making your interactions with Gemini more precise.
4. **Snapshot in Time:** It represents a snapshot of your project's structure at a given moment. As your project evolves, you might update `fileNames.md` periodically to reflect significant changes.

**Content and Structure of `fileNames.md`**

The `fileNames.md` file should be a simple Markdown file containing a hierarchical representation of your project's directory structure. Here's a breakdown of what to include:

1. **Hierarchical Structure:**

    *   Mimic your project's actual folder structure using indentation (spaces or tabs) or Markdown list syntax (using `-` or `*`).
    *   List both folders and files.
    *   **Example:**

    ```markdown

2. **File Descriptions:**

    *   **Concise and Informative:** For each file, add a *brief* (one sentence or phrase) description of its purpose or responsibility within the project.
    *   **Focus on "What" and "Why":**  Explain what the file contains and why it's important, rather than getting into detailed implementation specifics.
    *   **Plain Language:** Use clear, non-technical language as much as possible, as this is primarily for Gemini's understanding.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   `GregOSBootScreen.js`:  "Handles the initial boot sequence animation and displays system messages."
        *   `Chapter1.js`: "Renders the content and interactive elements for Chapter 1 of the narrative."
        *   `QuantumMind.js`: "Contains logic and data related to the fictional QuantumMind component in Project Amoratus."
        *   `api.js`: "Provides functions for making API calls to external services or a backend (if applicable)."
        *   `App.js`: "Main application component; handles routing and overall layout."
        *   `styles.css`: "Contains global styles for the application."

3. **Markdown Formatting (Optional):**

    *   You can use basic Markdown formatting to enhance readability:
        *   **Bold** for file or folder names.
        *   *Italics* for emphasis.
        *   Backticks (`) for code-like terms (e.g., function names, variable names).

**Example Snippet of `fileNames.md`:**

```markdown

```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Regular Updates:** As your project grows and changes, remember to update `fileNames.md` to reflect those changes. It's not meant to be a constantly updated, real-time representation, but rather a periodic snapshot. Update it when:
    *   You add or remove significant files or folders.
    *   The purpose of a file changes substantially.
    *   You restructure parts of your project.
*   **Level of Detail:**  Keep the descriptions concise. The goal is to give Gemini a general understanding, not a line-by-line explanation of your code.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent style for file names (e.g., CamelCase, snake_case) and descriptions throughout the document.

**How Gemini Uses `fileNames.md`**

When you provide `fileNames.md` to Gemini, it uses this information to:

*   **Understand Context:**  It gains a better understanding of how your project is organized and how different parts relate to each other.
*   **Identify Relevant Files:** When you describe an issue or request a feature, Gemini can use `fileNames.md` to pinpoint the files that are most likely involved.
*   **Generate More Accurate Code:** By knowing the purpose of different files, Gemini can generate code suggestions that are more likely to fit within your project's architecture and coding style.
*   **Reason About the Project:** It helps Gemini reason about the project as a whole, leading to more helpful suggestions and solutions.

In essence, `fileNames.md` acts as a bridge between your human understanding of the project and Gemini's ability to process and generate code. By providing this structured overview, you empower Gemini to be a more effective collaborator in your development process.
