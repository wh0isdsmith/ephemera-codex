# GregOS Boot Prompt

```markdown
**Feature:** Implement the "GregOS Boot Screen" as the initial landing page.

**Relevant Context (FRD Section):** This relates to the "Entry Point & Navigation" section of the FRD, specifically the "GregOS Boot Screen" feature.

**My Current Understanding/Initial Thoughts:** I need to create a component that simulates a text-based boot sequence with status messages, potential error codes, and a subtle loading animation. I'm thinking of using a JavaScript-based animation to achieve this. I want to use the browser console to log error messages to reflect the GregOS concept.

**Goal:**  I want a fully functional "GregOS Boot Screen" that creates the desired immersive experience as defined in the FRD.

**Considering I'll be using GitHub Copilot for implementation, can you help me:**
*   **Suggest the best approach to create the boot sequence animation and error logging?**
*   **Identify the specific files I should create or modify (e.g., a new component in `src/components/`)?**
*   **Provide any specific code examples or library suggestions (within the constraints of the tech stack) that could be helpful?**
